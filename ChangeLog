October 5 2002 - Version 1.6.0; The "better live" edition.

	Fragistics is now a perl frontend to the original raw fragistics
	engine. The frontend tries to provide a more "usual" usage. It has
	an own set of options that control the call of the 'rawfragistcs'
	engine.

	The rawfragistics engine is kept in nearly all of its internal
	functionality. It does better co-operation with a frontend and
	some small bugs are fixed.
	
	The source code is splitted into more files to get a more Java'oid
	one-class-one-file style and more natural making in the future.

	Compilation and installation is prepared with automake/autoconf.


April 4 2002 - Version 1.5.1; The "resurrection" edition.
	
	I took-over the Fragistics program, as found on 
	  http://planetquake.com/fragistics/

	Version 1.5.1 is based on the linux version of the last public
	release	v1.5 of the original author TroZ in April 13, 2000.

	I added a makefile, a shell script to extract the levelshots and
	player images from original .pk3-files, convert the images to be
	used in the fragistics-generated html pages, and a simple perl
	script to convert logfiles with different time format into the
	format understood by fragistics. Additionally I reworked the
	templates to a different color and table design and set them as
	the standard templates. The default result pages look a bit more
	attractive now. IMHO. :-)
