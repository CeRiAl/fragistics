	   Fragistics is a Quake3:Arena statistics program


Characteristics:
----------------

- original author: TroZ
- current maintainer: Steffen Schwigon
- written in C++, some sh and perl scripts
- Licences: GPL (C++ code) and Perl Artistic Licence (perl scripts)
- current project code size, incl. templates: 1.5 MB


Some history:
-------------

I took-over the Fragistics program in April 2002, as found on 
  http://planetquake.com/fragistics/.

Fragistics generates several webpages containing statistics about the
games played from the games.log generated by a Quake3:Arena server.

It seems there is no longer any maintenance of this program and I
couldn't reach the original author. Because Fragistics generates quite
cool statistics from Quake3 log files I decided to take this GPL
project and give it a new try by uploading it to sourceforge.net.


Immediate plans:
----------------

The initial sourceforge release will be based on the linux version of
the last public release v1.5 of the original author TroZ in April 13,
2000.

After the initial release I will add already prepared stuff by me and
publish a "resurrection" edition v1.5.1 containing:

- a makefile
- supporting shell/perl scripts
- new set of html templates (design changes)


Future plans:
-------------

- There are some bugs that still have to be fixed, I hope I get some
  help or at least any response from the net by making it more public
  via sourceforge.

- There are some features in log files generated by newer Quake
  versions/mods that I want to build into fragistics (e.g., osp stats
  with accuracy info)

- create Debian packages, maybe RPMs too

- Source and binary releases

- whole environment for a fully automated statistcs generation process

- Maybe the statistics engine could be encapsulated and then combined
  with another more standard html template mechanism.

- keep its platform independence


Licencing issues:
-----------------

The C++ code will stay GPL forever, of course. And this is good.

For my perl scripts (and only for those) I started to licence them
with Artistic Licence because it seems the perl community does this
quite often and I want to do my perl programming the "perl way of
life". (I'm quite new to perl and therefore still exploring that way
of live.)
