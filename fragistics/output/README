This is the directory where the output html is generated if
the rawfragistics engine is used without its frontend. 
If the frontend (fragistics) is used, the output is generated 
depending on the logfilename, e.g.: 
  $HOME/.fragistics/stats_<logfilebasename>/

This readme mainly exists to ensure the directory isn't pruned
on cvs update.
