This is the directory where the output html is generated if
the fragistics engine is used without frontend. 
If used with frontend, the output is generated depending on
logfilename, e.g.: 
  $HOME/.fragistics/stats_<logfilebasename>/

This readme mainly exists to ensure the directory isn't pruned
on cvs update.
