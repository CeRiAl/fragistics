INSTALL:
--------
Untar it as root in the root directory /

su -
cd /
tar xpzf fragistics.tgz

It will create a directory

  /etc/fragistics

and 2 files

  /usr/local/bin/fragistics
  /usr/local/bin/rawfragistics


HELP:
-----

  fragistics --help


SIMPLE USE:
-----------
Login as normal user. Try

  fragistics --logfile foo.log

This will create the stats in

  ~/.fragistics/stats/foo/


BETTER USE:
-----------
If you have more than one file then I recommend the spool mode.
Simply put all your logfiles (e.g., foo.log, bar.log) into

  ~/.fragistics/spool/

and call

  fragistics --spool

This will create the stats

  ~/.fragistics/stats/foo/
  ~/.fragistics/stats/bar/


PROBLEMS:
---------
If fragistics crashes, it is highly because of artefacts in the
gameslogfile left over by quake3. It would be nice, if you could
provide the gameslogfile to me, because I'm currently writing a
artefact corrector for typical problems on server side (e.g. server
restarts create unfinished incorrect log lines).
